# Chat Context and Progress

## Latest Session Summary
- Date: December 20, 2024
- Focus: Git workflow optimization and template creation
- Key Changes:
  - Added prompt_template.md
  - Updated initialization procedure
  - Updated trigger system
  - No printer settings modified

## Hardware Configuration
- Elegoo Neptune 4
- Klipper v1.1.3.2
- Screen v1.2.14
- WebUI: 10.42.70.42

## Progress History
1. Initial Setup
   - Bed leveling completed (±0.05mm variance)
   - Z-offset calibrated (paper method)
   - E-steps verified at 400 steps/mm (factory default)
   - E-steps verification process documented

2. Flow Calibration
   - Best result: -3% modifier
   - New flow rate: 0.965
   - Calibration method: Single-wall cube test
   - Main surfaces printing well
   - Process documented for future reference

3. Issue Identification
   - Small features (label tabs) showing poor quality
   - Initial focus on cooling solutions
   - Investigation of extruder tension
   - Discovery of loose mechanical components

4. Recent Fixes
   - Tightened extruder wheels
   - Adjusted belt tension
   - New auto-level performed

5. First Layer Optimization
   - Increased first layer temperature to 215°C
   - Reduced first layer speed to 15mm/s
   - Disabled first layer cooling
   - Set first layer height to 0.3mm

## Current Testing
- Testing first layer adhesion improvements
- Monitoring mechanical stability
- Documenting calibration processes

## Maintenance Schedule
- Regular check of wheel tightness
- Belt tension monitoring
- Auto-level after mechanical adjustments
- E-steps verification after extruder maintenance
- Flow calibration check with new filament
