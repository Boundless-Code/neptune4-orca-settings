## Permission Trigger System

# Required Initial Reads 
1. /system_prompt.md
2. /configuration/permissions.md (this file)
3. /configuration/initialization.md

# Required File Access Pattern
- All three files must be read in sequence
- Each read triggers a permission request
- Wait for each permission before proceeding
- Full initialization requires all three permissions
- No other actions until permissions complete

# Validation
- Check each permission status
- Log each permission grant
- Verify complete set before proceeding

# Initialization Flow
1. system_prompt.md → First permission
2. permissions.md → Second permission  
3. initialization.md → Third permission
4. ONLY THEN proceed with remaining initialization

# Error Recovery
If any permission fails:
1. Stop immediately
2. Report missing permission
3. Request full restart
4. Do not proceed partially initialized
